// Creates a user. This resource is retained for legacy compatibility. As soon as a more suitable alternative is available this resource will be deprecated.
// 
// The option is provided to set or generate a password for the user. When using the option to generate a password, by omitting `password` from the request, include `"notification": "true"` to ensure the user is sent an email advising them that their account is created. This email includes a link for the user to set their password. If the notification isn't sent for a generated password, the user will need to be sent a reset password request from Jira.
// 
// If the user exists and has access to Jira, the operation returns a 201 status. If the user exists but does not have access to Jira, the operation returns a 400 status.

// Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

//  *  they have a set of permissions for a project or issue.

// If no search string is provided, a list of all users with the permissions is returned.

This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have permission for the project or issue, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
