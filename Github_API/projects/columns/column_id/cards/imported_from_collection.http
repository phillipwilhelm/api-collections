// **Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key.
// 
// Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.
