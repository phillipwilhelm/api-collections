// To see many of the organization response values, you need to be an authenticated organization owner with the `admin:org` scope. When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`, the organization requires all members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to enable [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).
// 
// GitHub Apps with the `Organization plan` permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information about an organization's GitHub plan. See "[Authenticating with GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/)" for details. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below."

For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-12-03-internal-visibility-changes).

// List IdP groups available in an organization. You can limit your page results using the `per_page` parameter. GitHub generates a url-encoded `page` token using a cursor value for where the next page begins.

// 
// The `per_page` parameter provides pagination for a list of IdP groups the authenticated user can access in an organization. For example, if the user `octocat` wants to see two groups per page in `octo-org` via cURL, it would look like this:
