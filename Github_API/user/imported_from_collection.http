// 
// **Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
// reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
// the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
// request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

// List organizations for the authenticated user.

// **OAuth scope requirements**
// 
// This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a `403 Forbidden` response.
