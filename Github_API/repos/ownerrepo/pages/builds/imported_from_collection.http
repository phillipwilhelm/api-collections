// You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.
// 
// Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first completes.
