// **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Check team permissions for a repository](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#check-team-permissions-for-a-repository) endpoint.
// 
// You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/) via the `Accept` header:

@name("Check team permissions for a repository (Legacy)")
GET "https://{{baseUrl}}/teams/:team_id/repos/:owner/:repo"


// **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new "[Add or update team repository permissions](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions)" endpoint.
// 
// To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization.
// 
// Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

// **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Remove a repository from a team](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#remove-a-repository-from-a-team) endpoint.
// 
// If the authenticated user is an organization owner or a team maintainer, they can remove any repositories from the team. To remove a repository from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository and must be able to see the team. NOTE: This does not delete the repository, it just removes it from the team.
